# Checkers Game ðŸ•¹ðŸŽ®
<p>Checkers, also known as draughts in some parts of the world, is a two-player board game that is played on an 8x8 grid, similar to a chessboard. The game is played with 12 pieces for each player, typically differentiated by color (commonly red and black). The objective of the game is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or to block them so that they cannot make any legal moves.</p>

<p>Here are the basic rules for checkers:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Setup: The board is set up with each player's 12 pieces placed on the dark squares of the three rows closest to them.</li>
  <li>Movement: Each player's pieces can move diagonally forward one space at a time, but capturing an opponent's piece requires jumping over it diagonally to an empty square behind it. You can make multiple consecutive jumps if they are available in a single turn, forming a "double jump" or "multi-jump" sequence.</li>
  <li>Kinging: When a piece reaches the opponent's back row (the last row on their side of the board), it is "kinged" and gets a crown or a second piece stacked on top of it. A king can move both forward and backward diagonally.</li>
  <li>Capture: If you have the opportunity to capture an opponent's piece, you must do so. If multiple captures are possible, you can choose which one to make. Captured pieces are removed from the board.</li>
  <li>Winning: You win the game by either capturing all of your opponent's pieces or putting them in a position where they cannot make any legal moves.</li>
</ol>

<p>Checkers is a game that combines strategy and tactics, and it's relatively easy to learn but can be quite challenging to master due to the complexity of possible moves and counter-moves. It's a popular game played around the world and is often enjoyed for its competitive and strategic aspects.</p>
